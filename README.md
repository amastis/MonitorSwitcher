# MonitorSwitcher
Mac application to change focus between different monitors

## Known Limitations
- Not tracking the keybindings to store (instead type out the format of what commands to use)
- The monitor image does not update when adding or removing monitors (only updates on initial program run)
- when changing focus to a monitor where there are no full screen or other apps on the window causes all open apps to hide
